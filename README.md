# Hello there!

My name is Meike, I'm a web and software developer from Germany who loves to create helpful and practical tools and applications through the craft of code.

I've specialized in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, so scrolling through the repositories you will find anything from Node.js based APIs to desktop apps with Electron and SPAs created in React. You might also come across the odd little tool to make development life easier [or a bit more fun](https://github.com/mhanki/Nom) üê¢. 

<!--My experience includes working with a variety of modern technologies such as React, Node.js, TypeScript, Express, and both SQL and NoSQL databases.


üå± I'm an avid learner and always looking to expand my knowledge in the ever-evolving world of web development. Currently, I'm interested in exploring serverless architectures and microservices.

‚ö° Fun fact: In my free time, you can find me practicing yoga and meditation, or exploring new hiking trails.

üì´ Feel free to connect with me on GitHub or LinkedIn to discuss potential collaborations or just chat about all things tech!-->
