# Welcome

Hi! My name is Meike. I am an independent software and web developer from Germany. It's really nice to have you here!

My approach to development differs a bit from what seems to be the norm in today's fast-paced tech world. While I understand the need and value of keeping up with the newest technology trends, I  am wary of the way this overall rapidness has made its way into how we develop products.  
Programming is a craft. And as with any craft, the quality of the output is a direct result of the quality you put into it. That is why I take great pride in developing products that are not only custom tailored, but also easily maintainable and therefore highly durable. Technologies might change quickly, but well-designed code can last a lifetime.  


Specialising in a main technology stack is part of what allows me to achieve and maintain this level of quality when solving customers' problems and needs.
