# Welcome <img height="35" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhanki/mhanki/main/assets/daisy.png" />

Hi! My name is Meike. I am an independent software and web developer from Germany. It's really nice to have you here!

My approach to development differs a bit from what seems to be the norm in today's fast-paced tech world. While I understand the need and value of keeping up with the newest technology trends, I  am wary of the way this overall rapidness has made its way into how we develop products.  
Programming is a craft. And as with any craft, the quality of the output is a direct result of the quality you put into it. That is why I take great pride in developing products that are not only custom tailored, but also easily maintainable and therefore highly durable. Technologies might change quickly, but well-designed code can last a lifetime. 
  

## Tech Stack

Specialising in a main technology stack is part of what allows me to achieve and maintain this level of quality when solving customers' problems and needs. Working within the JavaScript ecosystem makes it possible to keep a consistent codebase while providing the possibility to develop services for various platforms. From websites to mobile apps and desktop applications, projects often share logical and visual components. Being able to adjust and configure these components in one place to then share them across [apps] makes development much less error prone, consistend, and more efficient.

## Community

<img width="80" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhanki/mhanki/main/assets/lavender-js-grey.png"/> One of the aspects I love most about being a developer is the ability to help make people's lives just a little bit easier. That is true not only when working with clients, but also when engaging with the coding community. From automation tools, UI- and software components to articles, I try to create and share whatever I find helpful in my own work, in the hope it can be useful for others too. If you are a developer yourself, feel free to have a look at some of these platforms to see if there is something of value to you:
